# Aquarium Automator
A device that helps monitor and automate basic aquarium/ fish tank needs


- Monitor
  - [Temperature](temperature_monitor.md)

- Automations
  - relay triggering
  - thermostat
  - notifications
- light schedule
  - fixed schedule - start by creating a [light schedule](light-schedule.md) in Home Assistant then add [automations](light_automation.md) to use it.
- Various reminders for chores, i.e.
  - Feeding
  - Water Cleaning/ Maintenance
  
### Platform ###
- [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) for sensor data and relay trigger
- [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) for schedule orchestration and notifications


### Requirements ###
- NodeMCU or other ESP based device - generally available. I had a NodeMCU lying in my inbox so that's what I used.
- Relay board (one relay per function you'd like to monitor/conrol). Got mine from local Bulgarian web shop [radev96.com](https://radev96.com)
- A 'dallas' DS18B20 single wire temperature sensor - despite the name it comes with 3 wires - V+,V-, Data
- A number of Dupont or jumper wires available from your local maker's store or online
- A 5V power supply unit that will supply power to the NodeMCU. Alternatively, you can use a power adapter as seen in the first picture.
- One power outlet per relay (in my case I also inluded an extra one that is always on for air supply). A power strip might also do the job if you have one in which outlets can be powered off individually
- Pieces of wire to connect the relays to the power outlets
- A box to put all these items in

### Assembly ###

Using dupon wires connect the relays and temperature sensors to the NodeMCU.

Safe pins for relays: GPIO 4, 5, 12, 13, 14 (see ref. 1)

Temperature sensor: GPIO 2/D4 (see ref. 2)

Connect the relays to the power outlets and try to fit everything in the box.

Connect the light, air pump and thermostat to the respective power outlets.

### Future Development ###
- Moisture/Water Insulation - kids, fish, fishtanks, water, electricityâ€¦
- micro-usb port exposure for potential serial connection without the need for disassembly
- variable schedule (i.e. gradually increase the light hours from 6 to 8 over a period of 3 months)
- Monitor water quality (ph?)
